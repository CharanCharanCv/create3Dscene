Explanation:

Basic Scene Setup: Initializes the Three.js scene, camera, and renderer.

Room Dimensions: The room is approximately 1000 square feet in area, assuming a square room for simplicity.

Room Creation: Floor, ceiling, and walls are created using PlaneGeometry and positioned appropriately.

 Lighting: Adds a point light and ambient light to illuminate the scene.

Random Object Placement: Randomly places a specified number of box geometries (representing interior objects) within the room.

Camera Position: Sets the camera position and orientation to give a good view of the room.

Render Loop: Continuously renders the scene and animates the objects with a small rotation for a dynamic effect.
